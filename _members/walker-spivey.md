Walker recently completed his M.S. and is joining the lab as a Ph.D. student. His M.S. work consisted of studying the physiological and lipid-metabolism related responses to heat-stress in peanut (*Arachis hypogaea*). Walker brings a unique set of skills and knowledge to the lab which includes molecular biology techniques, management of greenhouse systems, plant pathology, & crop physiology. 
In the Rife lab, Walker will conduct research which focuses on improving the breeding pipeline for various crops including lima bean (*Phaseolus lunatus*), sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor*), and sweet corn (*Zea mays*).
